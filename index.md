## Introduction
Hello, my name is Lixing He, an undergraduate student from UESTC major in Automation. I study at UC Berkeley as visiting student now and my advisor is Prof. Shijia Pan from UC Merced and Prof. Yanjun Li from UESTC.

## Research interest
My previous research project includes circuit design and signal processing, as well as optimization model. I am particularly interested in the application of Cyber-physical system, where I can apply my model in real-world.

## Experience
1. Visit student of National University of Singapore(Singapore), 2018
2. Campus electronic design contest(Chengdu, China) 2018
3. Earth information detection lab, signal processing in well digging(Chengdu, China), 2018, 2019
4. Undergraduate internship of China Academy Of Engineering Physics, machine learning in physics(Beijing, China), 2019
5. National mathematics modelling contest, responsible to modelling(Chengdu, China), 2019
6. Visiting Student of UC Berkeley, optimization model, DSP, AI(Berkeley, US), 2020
7. Intern student of UC Merced, sensor self-calibration based on sensor fusion(Merced, US), 2020

## Award

## Life
I am interested in technology, history, politics, military and Chinese traditional culture. I keep chasing the trend of technology, especially in sensing and control. As for history & politics & military, I feel excited to hear the legends. For example, general Jiang Wei(姜维) tried his best to save the country, and general Washington bravely led the Us independent war. Additionally, I follow the ancient Chinese quotes:" help the people, respect the nature and inherit the great knowledge from past", which is the source of my motivation in study.
